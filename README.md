# or in the offline mode
yarn dev:offline
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000>

## Structure

The product source code is structured with:

| Folder            | Explanation                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config/`         | Built and runtime configuration files.                                        |
| `lib/`            | All codes used into the application but that **do not use nuxt and vue**.     |
| `scripts/`        | All files called in the `package.json` script section.                        |
| `src/assets/`     | All static files that need to be served without i18n.                         |
| `src/components/` | All codes imported in the `src/pages/` files, **using nuxt and vue**.         |
| `src/locales/`    | All i18n json files.                                                          |
| `src/middleware/` | All files used in the server side.                                            |
| `src/pages/`      | All the application pages called with URL, served with **nuxt** and **i18n**. |

## Before commit

### Github Workflow

To ensure the Github CI CD pipeline will stay green, launch the following command before commit and have no error.

```shell
yarn lint & yarn test:coverage
```

## Code Analysis

### SonarQube Installation [Local Only]

If you want to know about your code analysis, you can use SonarQube for that. To
do so:  
Source: [https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Get+Started+in+Two+Minutes](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Get+Started+in+Two+Minutes)

### SonarQube Usage [Local Only]

> Do the [SonarQube Installation](#SonarQube-Installation-Local-Only) before starting any developments in order to know how it will change the metrics.  

Each time you want to know about your quality code, launch a scan with the following
command in the `cv-with-nuxt` folder! You will have your evolution ;)

```bash
# Start the server if needed
<SONARQUBE BIN PATH>\StartSonar.bat
# Create coverage reports
yarn test:coverage
# Launch the scan
<SONARQUBE SCANNER BIN PATH>\sonar-scanner.bat;
```

## Todo

- [ ] Move all configuration files (babel, nuxt, now) into `config/` folder.
- [ ] Optimize the Yarn cache folder in the Github pipeline (<https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#node---yarn>).
- [ ] Optimize the Sonar cache folders (~/.sonar/cache, .scannerwork) in Github pipeline.
