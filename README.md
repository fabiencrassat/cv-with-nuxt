## Prerequisites

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) Version 12
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) Version 1.22

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabiencrassat/cv-with-nuxt.git
```

Then install the packages

```bash
cd cv-with-nuxt
yarn
```

Run it!

```bash
yarn dev
# or in the offline mode
yarn dev:offline
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000/fabien>

## Structure

The product source code is structured with:

| Folder            | Explanation                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config/`         | Built and runtime configuration files.                                        |
| `lib/`            | All codes used into the application but that **do not use nuxt and vue**.     |
| `scripts/`        | All files called in the `package.json` script section.                        |
| `src/assets/`     | All static files that need to be served without i18n.                         |
| `src/components/` | All codes imported in the `src/pages/` files, **using nuxt and vue**.         |
| `src/locales/`    | All i18n json files.                                                          |
| `src/middleware/` | All files used in the server side.                                            |
| `src/pages/`      | All the application pages called with URL, served with **nuxt** and **i18n**. |

## Start like production

This site is a staic website. So to replicate what is deployed in the website there are some things to do first.

```shell
yarn generate
yarn start:static
```

And open the pages without extension: <http://localhost:3000/fabien>

## Before commit

### Github Workflow

To ensure the Github CI CD pipeline will stay green, launch the following command before commit and have no error.

```shell
yarn lint & yarn test:coverage
```

### Exclude some files

Adding some files in the root or config folder will change how the pipeline or test coverage will work.  
In this case and depending the context, exclude theses files in:

| Exclude in                 | Why                                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `config/jest.config.js`    | For the coverage in the key `collectCoverageFrom`.       |
| `.gitignore`               | Files not used in the version control system.            |
| `.nowignore`               | Files not used in the now deployment.                    |
| `sonar-project.properties` | For the coverage in the key `sonar.coverage.exclusions`. |

## Code Analysis

### SonarQube

#### SonarQube Installation [Local Only]

If you want to know about your code analysis, you can use SonarQube for that. To do so:  
Source: <https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Get+Started+in+Two+Minutes>

#### SonarQube Usage [Local Only]

> Do the [SonarQube Installation](#SonarQube-Installation-Local-Only) before starting any developments in order to know how it will change the metrics.  

Each time you want to know about your quality code, launch a scan with the following
command in the `cv-with-nuxt` folder! And you will have your evolution ;)

```bash
# Start the server if needed
<SONARQUBE BIN PATH>\StartSonar.bat
# Create coverage reports
yarn test:coverage
# Launch the scan
<SONARQUBE SCANNER BIN PATH>\sonar-scanner.bat;
```

### Google Chrome Lighthouse

#### Lightouse Server [Local Only]

If you want to know about your code audit, you can use Google Chrome Lighthouse for that. To do so, use the docker image already published:  
Source: <https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/recipes/docker-server/README.md#building-locally>

> The docker command is wrong for Windows, use instead:
>  
> ```shell
> docker container run --publish 9001:9001 --mount source=lhci-data,target=/data --detach patrickhulce/lhci-server
> ```

It will create a container server you can access at <http://localhost:9001/>.

Then initialize the project inside the server:

```shell
yarn lhci wizard
? Which wizard do you want to run? new-project
? What is the URL of your LHCI server? http://localhost:9001/
? What would you like to name the project? cv-with-nuxt
? Where is the project's code hosted? https://github.com/fabiencrassat/cv-with-nuxt
? What branch is considered the repo's trunk or main branch? master
Created project cv-with-nuxt (9461df84-ee42-4868-9061-62a8391c7fec)!
Use token xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx to add data.
Use admin token xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx to manage data. KEEP THIS SECRET!
```

Use the **LHCI server url** and the **token xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx** in your `.env` file.

```properties
LHCI_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9001
LHCI_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Lighthouse Usage [Local Only]

> Do the [Lighthouse Usage](#lightouse-installation-local-only) before starting any developments in order to know how it will change the metrics.  

Each time you want to know about your audit code, launch an audit with the following command in the `cv-with-nuxt` folder! And you will have your evolution ;)

> if needed, configure your `CHROME_PATH` in your `.env` file.

```shell
yarn generate
yarn start:static
```

And in an other shell:

```shell
yarn validate:lighthouse
```

## Todo

- [ ] Move all configuration files (babel, nuxt, now) into `config/` folder.
- [ ] Optimize the Yarn cache folder in the Github pipeline (<https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#node---yarn>).
- [ ] Optimize the Sonar cache folders (~/.sonar/cache, .scannerwork) in Github pipeline.
- [ ] Add `vue-styleguidist` package.
- [ ] Change test runner to cover Single File Component (<https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/choosing-a-test-runner.html#testing-single-file-components>).
- [ ] **[Waiting vue-jest@4.x.x]** Remove executable code in `vue` file to allow coverage with **vue-jest@3.x.x** (`h1.vue`, `leftSide.vue`).
  > Search for *`coverage is successful with vue-jest@4.x.x`* in the code.
